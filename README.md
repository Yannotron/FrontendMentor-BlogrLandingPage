## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://bulma.io) - For styles


### What I learned

It has been challenging I have to say. I am not happy with the transition from large screen to mobile and vice versa. And it shows...

It would mean a lot if someone could explain what I have been doing wrong.

I am rather happy with my navbar solution, although I am using some JS to help.

My limited knowledge of Sass means that I haven't been able to fully use the technology alongsife Bulma. It has been quite frustrating at times, but I am certain experience will overcome this eventually.
